      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about learning and exploring connections between different fields —
        from <strong> Philosophy, Logic, Mathematics, and Computer Science</strong> to 
        <strong>Cognitive Science, the Cold War period, and Quant Finance</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Music is one of my strongest inspirations: I listen to everything from classical
        and impressionist pieces to trip-hop and black metal, always finding new ways that sound can
        shape thought and emotion. Quant Finance is another constant in my life, offering
        unique insights into risk, models, and how theory translates into markets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside these interests, I have a background in <strong>Corporate Finance, Investments and Treasury</strong>,
        where I worked with investment & risk management, corporate strategy, and number-crunching on a daily basis. Over time I felt drawn
        toward broader intellectual pursuits — building a personal library, studying logic, computability, complexity and data science,
        and experimenting with Python projects that bring theory into practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, learning is not just professional growth — it’s a hobby, a passion, and a way of life.
        I believe in curiosity, creativity, and the balance between reason and imagination.

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>
        Music inspires me deeply. From classical and impressionist works to electronic and post-punk,
        sound shapes thought and emotion in unique ways.
