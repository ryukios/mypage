  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m passionate about learning and exploring connections between different fields â€” from 
    <strong>mathematics, philosophy, and computer science</strong> to 
    <strong>cognitive neuroscience, geopolitics, and literature</strong>. 
    I enjoy discovering how ideas from one discipline can enrich another, turning knowledge into 
    a living network rather than isolated fragments.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Music</strong> is one of my strongest inspirations: I listen to everything from 
    classical and impressionist pieces to trip hop and black metal, always finding new ways that sound can 
    shape thought and emotion. <strong>Literature</strong> is another constant in my life, with 
    both Western and Asian classics offering me unique insights into history, culture, and human 
    experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alongside these interests, I have a background in <strong>corporate finance and treasury</strong>, 
    where I worked with risk management, strategy, and numbers on a daily basis. This experience 
    sharpened my analytical skills, but over time I felt drawn toward broader intellectual pursuits â€” 
    building a personal library, studying logic and data science, and experimenting with Python projects 
    that bring theory into practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    For me, learning is not just professional growth â€” itâ€™s a hobby, a passion, and a way of life. 
    I believe in curiosity, creativity, and the balance between reason and imagination.
